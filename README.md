# BitcoinExchangeRateModel

The bitcoin/USD daily closes are extremely autocorrelated. 

This model takes advantage of that, and incorporates the halving events both as a catalyst for the next cycle 
and the concept of reduced volatility with each halving. 

The model might be useful or interesting for some. 

I only ask that you credit me when/if you use it.

Thanks
Nick.
